		<p> The 3D Slicer platform is a biomedical research software, covering image informatics, image processing, and three-dimensional visualization. It is supported by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) and 3D Slicer is deployed under open source license which do not restrict their use. Although its functionalities cover the needs of medical professionals and students in a wide variety of aspects, one important feature as it is its availability in different languages still has not being implemented (or completely implemented).</p>

		<p>The aim of this project is to develop/improve the 3D Slicer globalization support. The software globalization is the translation process of software from a source language into a target language. The process is divided into two steps: software internationalization (i18n) and software localization (l10n). The former is the task of designing software without a specific location i.e. building it independent of any specific language or culture. The latter is the process of adapting a software for a specific location.</p>
		
		<p>In this page, you can find the translated files which the strings displayed in the 3D Slicer graphics user interface. The supported languages are English, French and Spanish:</p>
